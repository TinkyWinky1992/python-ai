You use your creativity to imagine people you will meet and you write down a description then you associate them with a positive message or encouraging word. Maybe you saw a teenage boy in a red hat at the shopping mall in your imagination then while at the mall you may find someone who matches that description. You show that you have a message for him and that you have a message for a boy in a red hat. You then give him a message of kindness or whatever was on your heart. You have no idea sometimes you meet someone who is having a really hard day and it brings them to tears to have a stranger show them love."

        "Human 2": " All the times. My work involves a few types of fish and a few types of nets. I just put the nets on the fish to see how the fish will react. Every time I do that I think of going to the beach."

    },
    "1442": {
        "Human 2": " Yes thats close. My research focuses on jellyfish and pufferfish. Many of them a poisonous but if processed correctly they would make hi-end foods. I try to find the best recipes to bring these fish to the tables."

    "1443": {
        "Human 1": " Woah! This is very interesting! I have honestly never heard of such kind of work. Is it dangerous at all?"
    },
    "1444": {
        "Human 2": " Yes and no. Because its obviously dangerous we all have to wear protective clothes. Thus accidents almost never happen."
    },

        "Human 1": " Hmmm yes I have heard that. Apparently most mountain climbers fall not on the most dangerous routes but on the easier routes when their guard is down! Sounds like the same psychological phenomenon."

        "Human 1": " Cool. Which conference? I saw on Twitter the other day some people saying they were denied visas for some conference in Canada. Perhaps its the same one. I really liked this place called Kingyo. It has good Japanese food if youre into that."

    },
    "147": {
        "Human 1": " Oh very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood but these days with climate change I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do."

    },
    "1473": {
        "Human 1": " Cause the environment and humans suck. Im keeping my bets open for space though in case the environment dies. I mixed up a couple of dishes. It was a buffet style place."

        "Human 2": " I did more when I was in grad school (and had more time). I would usually go with friends. For a while I would go to the farmers market in Santa Cruz every week and try to feel if there is something I am supposed to tell a stranger. Usually they are vague hope-filled messages but its weird when I blurt out something oddly specific."

        "Human 2": " hmm I havent thought about that much but i think lotus should be one of my favorites. Why do you ask?"
    },
    "174": {
        "Human 1": " Im working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?"
    },
    "175": {
        "Human 2": " Nice! Lotus looks pretty cool and It has some delightful vibe. So what is this research about?"
    },
    "176": {
        "Human 1": " Oh its not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate."
    },
    "177": {
        "Human 2": " Interesting! Whats your favorite flower?"
    },
    "178": {
        "Human 1": " The gerbera. Its like a cartoon flower. As if you drew \"flower\" with a crayon and then it came to life."
    },
    "179": {
        "Human 2": " Nice i would love know more about your theory. Like how you can deduce personality from flower preference."

        "Human 1": " my friends are gonna visit me this weekend. we might go hiking!"
    },
    "180": {
        "Human 1": " Ok step 1 is you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?"
    },
    "181": {
        "Human 2": " yes"
    },
    "182": {
        "Human 1": " Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more and ask them some more questions and gradually develop a sense of what theyre like over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila"

        "Human 2": " Hehe i think you should publish this someday :)"

        "Human 2": " Mint chocolate chips. I think your croissants not being flakey could have something to do with your ovens temperature."

        "Human 1": " Ah good thought thanks!"
    },
    "514": {
        "Human 2": " Have you thought about melting some chocolate into your croissants? They dont have to be something unhealthy. For example melted dark chocolate is good for the heart and makes the resulting croissants taste much better."
    },
    "515": {
        "Human 1": " Now that is a good idea. Ill give it a try next time. Would you say you have a sweet tooth?"

    "517": {
        "Human 1": " Some people dont! But yeah me too I think Id eat pastries all the time if I could get away with it."
    },
    "518": {
        "Human 2": " Yeah Im afraid I wouldnt. I feel very guilty every time I gulp down an ice cream. But hey these days there are many types of guilt-free sweet food. For example theres this ice cream brand called <REDACTED_TERM>. Its only 320 calories a pint. And yes it preserves most of the normal sweet flavors."
    },
    "519": {
        "Human 1": " Wow! The last time I paid attention to that sort of stuff was when <REDACTED_TERM> was being marketed as a fat substitute and caused all sorts of crazy stomach upsets."

        "Human 1": " Where I grew up we had lots of water trouble too..."
    },
    "520": {
        "Human 2": " Interesting. I heard about the sweet substitute in a program called the Keto diet. Basically we try to limit our sugar intake every day. Successful Keto dieters have recommended the <REDACTED_TERM> ice cream to fill their insatiable crave for sugar."
    },
    "521": {
        "Human 1": " Ah maybe thats the solution I need to enjoy sweets and not feel guilty \ud83d\ude42"

    "528": {
        "Human 1": " True! I think thanksgiving is more about sharing. So you may end up sharing the pie with the whole family :P"

        "Human 2": " My family eats healthier than I do so its all mine \ud83d\ude1b do you like stuffing? I feel like thats only available once a year"

I just know that one minute I was in the US and then they put me on a plane to Taiwan and I never saw my stuff again. In some ways it made me more sentimental.

    },
    "797": {
        "Human 2": " nice! I love NYC \ud83d\ude42 so fun to visit yeah I would probably also say New York is my favorite city inside the US I also like Paris its so pretty there"
    },

        "Human 2": " Thats such a great idea especially at this time of the year. Im not too big a fan of the cold. I prefer warmer climates. Do you enjoy the cold?"
    },
    "806": {
        "Human 1": " Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we dont get to suffer extreme cold weather!"
    },
    "807": {
        "Human 2": " Me too! I moved here a few years ago to get out of the extreme cold. I do not care for bundling up and having to wear so many layers just to go buy eggs at the store."

        "Human 1": " Oh nice! Where did you live before?"
    },
    "809": {

    },
    "820": {
        "Human 1": " A couple projects that I am trying to finish up before Thanksgiving \ud83d\ude42 Do you have any fun plans for the break?"

        "Human 1": " Haha XD so what do you like to do for fun?"
    },
    "823": {

    },
    "827": {

        "Human 2": " wow! thats amazing did you do any marathons this year?"
    },

        "Human 1": " Ha! Dont drink and zipline mate!"
    },
    "830": {
        "Human 1": " No. Not this year. This is my half-marathon year. Instead of running marathons I run one half-marathon every month."

        "Human 2": " oh wow what was the last half marathon you did?"
    },
    "832": {

    },
    "837": {
        "Human 2": " thats nice. I am just working on some documentation. Do you play pingpong often?"

    },
    "842": {
        "Human 1": " Whats racquetball like? From context clues Im guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet"
    },
    "843": {
        "Human 2": " well its like a cage match of tennis. The main difference is that both players play in the same court and the ball is smashed against a wall instead of passing it over a net into the opponents court. Kind of like playing pingpong vs the table."
    },
    "844": {
        "Human 1": " Wow! A cage match! Does it get physical?"
    },
    "845": {
        "Human 2": " it depends haha there is a lot of bumping into each other to run after the ball and sometimes the ball hits you too. Overall it feels like a super fast paced version of tennis really tiring!"
    },
    "846": {
        "Human 1": " That sounds fun. I think of tennis itself as being really athletic and tiring so I dont think its a sport for me though!"
    },
    "847": {
        "Human 2": " ping pong can get quite intensive too! I guess short ping pong sessions are not that tiring though. Wanna have a match?"
    },

    "946": {
        "Human 2": " Yeah sunlight is good. I wish I could live part-time in different parts of the world to have summer all year round. Have you ever visited the southern hemisphere?"

    },
    "958": {
        "Human 2": " Honestly I like to catch Pokemons on my phone a lot. That must be upsetting since your name is pikachu though...sorry..."
    },
    "959": {
        "Human 1": " Oddly enough I also catch Pok\u00e9mon on my phone. I used to do it more but it just never ends. I used to do it everyday. Now I mostly catch them when I travel somewhere exotic."

    },
    "992": {
        "Human 1": " Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?"
    },
    "993": {
        "Human 2": " Yeah I think so. It might be a tough decision though if we want to have a nice dinner then we have to leave the parks early to start cooking. Another option is to have dinner at a restaurant."
    },
    "994": {
        "Human 1": " but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve"
    },
    "995": {
